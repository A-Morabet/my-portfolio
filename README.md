# Portfolio Website


You'll find here the code to my portfolio website, I chose to make it as lightweight as possible using *HTML*, *CSS* and a bit of *JavaScript* to handle some of the logic for the portfolio items.

However throughout its development I maintained a firm posture that a stylized portfolio could still be achieved, at the header of the portfolio *yuxtaposed waves* as well as *contraposed ones* can be seen and they serve the purpose of transitioning the user into a different color palette without being too sudden.

Another example that can be considered as a quality of life feature as well as something stylish would be *the GIF sequence that plays to showcase a project when hovering over their picture for a bit*.

**I hope you navigating through my Portfolio!**
